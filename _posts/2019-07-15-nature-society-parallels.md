A random thought went through my mind lately.

I remember back in high school my physics teacher demonstrated the philosophical significance of the Lenz's Law. The law, stated in 
it's original context, described the magnetic field created by induced current always opposes the initial changing magnetic field, 
which, can be further summarised as

I remember how my teenage mind was blown by it. Though I haven't come across any more of these examples through these years.

Until recently. I stumbled across an interview to Lee Kuan Yew on Youtube (which link I cannot find and it's really troubling me).
He mentioned that in international politics, when you are powerful enough, you bend the rules.

If you think light travels in straight line in vacuum, in certain context, as a rule. You will 'bend' the rule if you are massive enough.
And even 'absorb' light when you gets real massive.

Yet another interesting parallel the nature casted in human society.
