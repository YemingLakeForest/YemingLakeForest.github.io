I did some online questionnaire that accesses your 'political compass' through a series of multiple choice questions.

Here are my results:

**Economic Left/Right: -2.63**

**Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -1.03**

These results are not inaccurate. I am mildly on the left side and on-the-fence-ish on liberty/collectivism split.

To critique this questionnaire a little, I find this interpretation of political stance is missing a rather important 
and pivotal axis - **theism vs. rationalism**. I can't see how this would fit into either Economic Left/Right or 
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian axes, and your stance in this spectrum as a profound impact on one's behaviours and 
interactions with the world.

Also, 'scores' or 'metrics' like these tend to re-enforce one's minds and believes. When slotted in a certain category 
one would naturally resist revision to their views, kidnapped by confirmation bias and goes down a downward spiral of 
extremism.

You don't want that.
